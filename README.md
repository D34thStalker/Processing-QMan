Q-MAN
=====

Q-Man is a game written in Processing that can be best described as a mashup of Qbert and Pacman, with a special twist from our soon-to-be alma mater Brooklyn College.


About the Game
=====

You play as Q-man, a comp-sci student by day, and a spreader of spring cheer also by day. After a long and brutal NYC winter, the Brooklyn College quad is in some desparate need of some water. Due to some mixup through CUNY administration, the sprinkler system can only be activated if someone changes each of the tiles along the quad to a certain color. That's where Q-man comes in. In efforts to make the campus alive again, Q-man has brought the task on himself to activate the sprinkler system to return the quad to a state of hip collegiate merriment. Just watch out for the mean spirited anti-fun security guards who will ask for your IDs and throw you off the quad, because then it's GAME OVER.
